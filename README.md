## Discovery Project (Implementation of GraphRAG to increase faithfulness and accuracy of LLM's information retrieval)

This project was carried out during my last year at Western Sydney University, my scope of research was to create and deploy GraphRAG, which is a recent innovation pioneered by Microsoft. You can read more about its publication [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.16130).

In addition, the work is inpsired and built upon various other work, I would like to show my appreciation for all those who helped me built this and passed my units :)

The GraphRAG model essentially consists of two pipelines:

+ **Retrieving pipeline** 
+ **Generation pipeline**

Please find the following illustrations:

The project is still a work in progress as it's being adjusted and refined for integration with RAG and AI Agents to create a complete chatbot that can widely used.
